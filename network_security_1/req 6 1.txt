Network Security Tools Usage Report
1. Wireshark Capture and Analysis

Wireshark Overview: Wireshark is a widely used tool for network protocol analysis. It captures network traffic and provides insights into potential security risks, such as unencrypted sensitive data transmission.

Wireshark Capture Overview:

File Used: ftp-passwords101.pcapng
Capture Summary: The packet capture was analyzed to assess unencrypted FTP traffic that may include sensitive data, such as passwords.
Key Findings from the Capture:

The capture contains FTP traffic, which is not encrypted. FTP transmits data, including usernames and passwords, in plaintext.
Sensitive Information Detected: The captured FTP packets reveal the transmission of login credentials, including usernames and passwords, which are visible in plaintext.
Analysis:

Risk: The transmission of credentials over unencrypted FTP makes the network vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. An attacker with access to the network can easily capture and view these credentials.
Recommendation: It is strongly recommended to switch from FTP to FTPS or SFTP, both of which offer encryption for secure data transmission.
2. Network Vulnerability Scanner Report

Nmap Overview: Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can detect active hosts, open ports, and services running on a network.

Nmap Scan Details:

Tool Used: Nmap 7.94SVN
Scan Date: January 22, 2025
Scan Type: ARP Ping Scan (Host Discovery)
Targets Scanned: 256 IP addresses in the local network range.
Scan Results:

Hosts Up: 2 active hosts discovered in the scan (10.138.16.210, 10.138.16.105).
MAC Addresses Identified:
10.138.16.210: Apple device (MAC Address: 8C:7A:AA:E6:4F:51).
Network Latency: Very low latency, indicating a fast connection between devices.
Key Findings:

Only two hosts were active in the scanned range, indicating minimal activity or potentially secure configurations that restrict unnecessary services.
Recommendation: Regularly monitor network activity and configure firewalls or segmentation for better security, particularly if only a few devices are expected on the network.
3. Network Penetration Testing Tool Output

Penetration Testing Overview: Penetration testing (or ethical hacking) involves simulating an attack to evaluate the security of a network or system. In this scenario, Nmap and other penetration testing tools can help assess the network's security posture.

While the specific results of a penetration test weren't provided in the files, it is implied that network scanning and vulnerability assessment using Nmap have been conducted to check for active hosts and open ports.

Penetration Testing Steps Suggested:

Service Enumeration: After discovering active hosts with Nmap, a deeper scan can be performed to identify services running on the open ports. This step is critical to identify vulnerable services.
Vulnerability Scanning: Tools like Nessus or OpenVAS can be used to scan the discovered services for known vulnerabilities.
Exploitation: Once vulnerabilities are identified, ethical hackers can attempt exploitation using tools like Metasploit to simulate attacks and gain access to systems.
Post-Exploitation: After successful exploitation, further actions such as maintaining access, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration can be simulated to assess the potential damage in a real attack scenario.
Conclusion and Recommendations
This report demonstrates the use of multiple network security tools to assess the network's security posture:

Wireshark: Revealed that FTP traffic is transmitting sensitive data like usernames and passwords in plaintext. It's highly recommended to switch to a more secure protocol like FTPS or SFTP.
Nmap: Scanned the network to discover active hosts and identified a few devices with low latency. Further action to check open ports and services is recommended.
Penetration Testing: Network penetration testing, including service enumeration and vulnerability scanning, should be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
By addressing the risks identified in the scan and analysis, the network can be secured against a variety of attacks, especially related to data interception and unauthorized access. Regular scans and updates to software and protocols will further enhance network security.
